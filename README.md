# Kotlin Trivia

This app is based on the fourth project in [**Developing Android Apps with Kotlin**](https://eu.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012) by
**Udacity** and **Google**. The app is a simple trivia game that randomly choses 3 questions from a MutableList. If correctly answered, the user can share the result and choose to start a new game, otherwise TryAgain fragment allows to start over again.<p>
App displays a NavigationDrawer to jump to alternative destinations like AboutFragment and TriviaRules and uses the Navigation Components library from Android JetPack to power up the navigation and transition animations between fragments.
